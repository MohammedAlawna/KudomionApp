# Kudomion

Kudomion is a .NET MAUI social media application built for the Yu-Gi-Oh! community, offering a modern way for duelists to connect, compete, and share strategies. It represents the Yukajo Duel Academy forum (est. 2008) and brings its competitive scene into a modern mobile and desktop experience.

> 🛠 Started in 2022 using Xamarin, later upgraded to .NET MAUI. Due to compatibility issues with NuGet package versions, the project was fully migrated to a new repository for stability and maintainability.
